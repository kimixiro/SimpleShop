# SimpleShop

One of the modules of my category "simple" that I prepared for game jam.

New items are created by right-clicking, after which the new item must be transferred to the array of items on the store object.

Development is still in progress, there are many drawbacks, you can also come across strange get child that I will soon remove and replace with normal requests.

My task is to create a simple convenient store module without a bunch of unnecessary code and inheritance. 
Items should be easy to add via a simple database, and the implementation of new ones should be done by inheriting from an abstract class.

If it is not already implemented, be careful about using this module, also I have not completed it yet.
